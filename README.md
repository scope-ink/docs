# Welcome to Scope Docs

Scope is a way to visualize the contributions of software engineers which have traditionally been difficult to track. Using methods of measuring productivity such as line counting and verbal updates, is outdated and inaccurate. Scope aims to give you a complete insight into the work of your engineers, and your engineers the recognition they deserve.
