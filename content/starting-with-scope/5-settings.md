From the Settings panel, you can setup everything in the application: profile, integrations and manage your subscription.

## Integrations 

Please, visit our [Integrations page](https://docs.scope.ink/integrations) to see the full integration process for every SCM.

## Subscription

The Subscription tells you which plan you have active and how many repositories are you able to analyze. The number of repositories you can receive data from depends on the number of repositories you have payed for. Please, visit our [pricing plan](https://scope.ink/pricing "pricing plan") for more information.

Since June 2020, you are able to pay directly from the app. For that, select the number of repositories that you want to receive data from. Once you pay for 1 repository, you will be a Pro user of Scope. What does it mean?

- You will only receive metrics from your payed repositories
- You will have at least 3 months of data availability
- You will receive a premium support
- You will be in the official Scope Slack channel

**Important note:** once you pay, your two free repositories from Basic Plan will be converted to Pro Plan repositories. So, for example, if you have 2 free repositories, but you want to add 2 more repositories, you should pay for 4 repositories, not only for the two new ones.

If you want to upgrade your available number of repositories in Scope, add the quantity of repositories you want to add to the form and click on **Proceed to Checkout**. You will be redirected to a Stripe Checkout.
