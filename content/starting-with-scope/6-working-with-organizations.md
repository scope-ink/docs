## The process depends on how you log in:

**1. If you Login with GitHub**

If you Sign Up with **GitHub** you need to **Grant Access** in the Login process to your Organization. Most probably, your Organization will have private repositories. In case your organziation have public repositories, the *Grant Access* will be confirmed by default. 

## How to Grant Access to an Organization

When you click on the **Login with GitHub** button, the OAuth protocol pop-up will appear. It **should** automatically detect all the organizations in which you are collaborator or administrator. After that, you have to **Grant Access** to your profile and all the organizations you want to receive data from Scope.

Once you click on the *Grant Access* button, you have to click on the **Authorize scopeink** button to be redirected to the application.

**2. If you Login with GitLab**

GitLab organizations and projects are added by default. If you have issues while trying to receive data from organizations, projects or teams, please, write us!
